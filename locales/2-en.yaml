  <b>Hello! 👋</b>
  I add <u>reactions</u> and <u>custom comments</u> to your messages. You can add me to your channel, give me permission to edit messages, and also, you can add me to groups that are connected to your channel.

  • If you want to change all messages or change emojis, press the buttons or use the /channels command to configure. <i>To display channels, you need to first send any message.</i>

  <b>• Do you need help or do you have a suggestion?</b> Write to me: @Real_Coder. Please write in a clear, simple, and understandable manner (Only in Uzbek).
  <b>• If you like the bot,</b> you can help me via this link: @RealCoderCard
